<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>

<i>Sometimes you want to draw attention to something in a line of text.</i>

<b>Sometimes you want to strongly emphasize something in the text!</b>

<b><i>Sometimes you want to do both.</i></b>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

<p>Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.<br> Neither can image tags</br/>, or hard lines.
<br> Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.<br/></p>

<h2>Images </h2>
<p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>

<img src= 'images2/images/mochi.gif' alt= "Bouncing mochi">
<img src= 'images2/images/mochi.jpg' alt= "Happy mochi">
<img src= 'images2/images/mochi.png' alt= "Small mochi">
<img src= 'images2/images/mochi.svg'alt= "Tiny Mochi">
